## About

![Image title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAGAR-TAMANG/ssb-docs/master/img/paraj_headshot2.jpg){ align=right }

The main motivation of this project is to enable a reliable way to prepare for the Service Selection Boards Exam.

The idea for creating this began when _Sagar Tamang's_ big brother _Paraj Bahadur Tamang_, who is currently in __Officer's Training Academy Chennai (OTA Chennai)__, suggested a need for an app that could provide a seamless way to practice for Service Selection Board's Tests. 

Soon enough, _Sagar Tamang_ began building the entire project under his guidance.
